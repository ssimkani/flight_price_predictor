# Flight Price Predictor

## Overview

The Flight Price Predictor is an application designed to analyze historical flight data and predict future ticket prices using a machine learning algorithm.

## Purpose

It helps users make informed decisions about the best time to book flights.

## Machine Learning Algorithm

The ML model used is a gradient boosting algorithm. Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique that combines multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a strong learner than can accurately make predictions. This ensemble model works by sequentially fixing the errors of its predecessors. Below is a picture illustrating the process of how gradient boosting works.
